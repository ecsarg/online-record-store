Access to the GitHub project and clone or download the project, you can do this by clicking in the green button with the word "Code". If you decided to clone the repo you need to choose one of the SSH/HTTPS keys and copy one, after this you will need to open the terminal of your choice and type "git clone 'key'" you will need to paste one of the two keys you previously select and then click enter.

To use this app you will need to download and install the terminal for mac or gitbash for windows. You may also need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) using the terminal. You will open the project in the code editor of your choice and then open the terminal and type "npm install" or "npm i" to install all the dependencies required. It will be necessary to create a file called ".env" with the following information: "DB_NAME='ecommerce_db' DB_USER='root' DB_PASSWORD='(your password)'" After that is created we are able to run the schema.sql file, for this is necessary to type in the terminal "mysql -u root -p" and then introduce your password, with that done we can type "source db/schema.sql;" and then we are good to quit it typing "quit;". Finally you will be able to start the app typing "npm start" or "node server.js" on your terminal or gitbash. You can see the local website in the following link: http://localhost:3001/
